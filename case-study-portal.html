                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <p>The customer portal served as a vital hub for users to manage personal data, apply for
                            finance, make payments, and access loan information. However, the platform design was
                            outdated, and modifying it previously depended heavily on third party development.
                            <br><br>
                            The portal suffered from an outdated design that underutilised available screen space;
                            lacking modern features and clear functionality. It also lacked crucial visual cues such as
                            icons, badges and distinct button shapes, compromising it’s usability and clarity of purpose
                            for users.

                        <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
                        <p>Removing the non-functional “hero” banner and reducing the bright colours to declutter the
                            visual layout while assigning meaning and recognition to the retained colours.
                            <br><br>
                            On-screen actions would be re-ordered based on user and business priorities. Icons and
                            badges would be introduced with the aim of guiding customers towards frequently used and
                            essential features.
                            <br><br>
                            The layout would also be newly optimised for mobile.

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>Upon comparison with our direct and indirect competitors, it became apparent that our portal fell
                    short of customer expectations.
                    <br><br>
                    While our portal had an inefficient “Hello” banner, competitors utilised their headers to deliver
                    relevant product news and display customer balances, providing more valuable information.
                    <br><br>
                    Coloured buttons, while aligning with the brand, lacked clarity due to the absence of icons, vague
                    action titles, and shared colours across unrelated features. This would pose challenges for users
                    with impaired colour vision and situations requiring black-and-white displays, impeding action
                    identification and page distinction.

                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>After creating the initial Figma design sketches, I collaborated with the Portal team, leveraging
                    their experience with direct customer interaction. This collaboration spanned several weeks and
                    involved multiple feedback sessions. Valuable insights emerged from this iterative process,
                    indicating that customers would benefit from condensed announcements in a smaller header.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, it was identified that prominently displaying customer number, balance, and customer
                    service agent contact details on the initial home screen would provide easy access to vital
                    information typically required when reaching out to us for assistance.
