                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <p>Originally, the MCL loan sale journey was built to serve customers in the home only. Due to
                            operational challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the journey needed to be changed to
                            meet
                            the resulting shift in customer behaviour towards remote & digital services.
                            <br><br>
                            The journey could be lengthy, with customers becoming fatigued with repeating their info
                            between
                            the broker and their customer service agent.
                            <br><br>
                            The technology being used at the time also created a dependency on various third parties,
                            which
                            came at a high cost.

                            <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
                            <p>The new journey needed to be adaptable based on how the customer was applying, whether
                                that be via a broker, through us directly as a new customer, or returning from our
                                customer portal.

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>In the absence of concrete customer data, relying on established UX best practices was the most
                    pragmatic approach for our research. Leveraging tried-and-tested methodologies enabled us to ensure
                    a strong foundation for our design decisions.

                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>Initial wireframes were shaped by research into best practices. Wireframes were then shown to product
                    employees across the business to help flesh out the questions we would need to ask customers.
                    <br><br>
                    After first release, the journey was expanded on using customer feedback and HotJar recording
                    sessions to identify and improve on problem areas.

                    <h2>Visual Language</h2>
                    <p>Morses Club as it was when this project began, made use of 4 bright colours throughout it’s
                        branding: blue, orange, pink and green. While this was effective in creating a stand-out
                        website, carrying all of them over into this long form risked visually overloading the customer.
                        <br><br>
                        In the past, Morses heavily utilised the orange and blue colours in their branding (green and
                        pink coming in more recently). Combined with them being complementary to one another, it felt
                        most appropriate to use these on the form.

                <h2>Component Library</h2>
                <p>Established a Figma Component Library post-wireframe development, housing reusable elements for
                    consistency and scalability across current and future designs.
                    <br><br>
                    This approach streamlined implementation for programmers and QA testers by ensuring cohesion across
                    current and future designs. The library’s creation promoted design consistence, easting
                    implementation and facilitating efficient testing and development without extensive oversight.

                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p>The move to this digital journey enabled our customers to determine their loan eligibility without
                    having to rely on our opening hours, or a customer service agent being available.
                    <br><br>
                    Moving to an internally managed design allowed us to reduce our dependency on third party suppliers,
                    making it faster and more cost effective to change based on customer feedback.
                    <br><br>
                    Internally managing the journey’s design also meant that it would be easier to capture user
                    behaviour data and use that to drive future changes, such as the Income and Expenditure Changes.
