                <h2>DDL Library & Journey</h2>
                <p>Built out a Figma library and page-based journey with fleshed-out demos to represent the existing
                    website.
                    <br><br>
                    Building out the Figma library helped to maintain the consistency of visual elements across future
                    designs. It also allowed for much faster prototyping of and iteration on new features.
                    <br><br>
                    Recreating the customer journey allowed us to properly visualise and understand how users navigate
                    through the website, leading to more informed decisions about what features could be added, moved,
                    etc. This also served as a good visual guide to our journey for new team members, and aided with
                    training and onboarding.

                <h2>Repayment Plan Tool</h2>
                <p>Designed the UI/UX for a “Repayment Plan Tool” that would be seamlessly integrated into our contact
                    form. Developed flow where user selects a query indicative of financial challenges i.e. “I am unable
                    to make a payment”. On selection, users are given the option to redirect to the Repayment Plan Tool.
                    <br><br>
                    This tool acted as an early intervention mechanism for users facing such difficulties and allowed
                    them to independently access help even when a customer service agent was unavailable.

                <h2>Maintenance</h2>
                <p>Conducted comprehensive maintenance on the DDL main website and customer portal, prioritising
                    user-centric design and addressing key usability concerns.
                    <br><br>
                    Notable enhancements include:
                    <br>&nbsp;• Implementation of collapsible sections on the Terms & Conditions page for improved
                    readability.
                    <br>&nbsp;• Introduction of a dedicated “Money Worries” page and tab to assist financially unstable
                    customers.
                    <br>&nbsp;• Addition of “Add to Homescreen” notices within the portal to encourage users to bookmark
                    the site on their mobile devices.
                    <br><br>
                    These maintenance enhancements strengthened trust in the brand by demonstrating continuous
                    commitment to customers wellbeing and the implementation of their feedback.
