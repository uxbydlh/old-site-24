                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Having no existing customer data to rely on meant that the initial design for the digital customer
                    journey had a degree of freedom and exploration in its design. However, it also meant that the
                    initial Income and Expenditure page design was primarily driven by business interests and compliance
                    guidelines, rather than being more tailored to fit our userbase.
                    <br><br>
                    The Income and Expenditure section of our online form faced poor customer reception. Customers could
                    not figure out the purpose of the disposable income calculation, or why we needed to take certain
                    inputs from them. This was not aided by the length of the page, which was much longer than other
                    pages in the form.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="left-title-para align-centre">
                <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
                <p>Rather than sticking with a single page, we opted to take the I&E inputs and spread them across our
                    existing form pages. Relevant I&E questions would be grouped with other existing questions in a
                    similar vein. For example: mortgage and rent payment questions would be placed next to address and
                    household questions.

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>To gain a clearer understanding of where we stood among our competitors in terms of I&E questions,
                    other online lenders were examined. The majority of them had significantly shorter I&E sections,
                    with some of the longer variants splitting the questions across the rest of the form, and others
                    providing a summary detailing the monetary amounts entered by the user.
                    <br><br>
                    HotJar analysis helped to determine which areas of the form were most likely to be filled
                    incorrectly. It also revealed that users failed to make use of the tooltips most of the time. What
                    was notable however, was that when a customer did manage to use the tooltips, they would go on to
                    use them for most inputs on the form.
                    <br><br>
                    This told us two things:
                    <br>&nbsp;• Customers did not know the majority of I&E inputs off the top of their head, and were
                    either filling them in incorrectly, or not at all
                    <br>&nbsp;• Customers needed to be shown more information to feel like they could comfortably answer
                    our questions.

                    Why do customers hate filling in forms?*
                    Forms are too long (74.3%):
                    “Too many pages, time consuming.”
                    “Too many open-ended questions.”
                    “Too lengthy and I believe they have most of the information in their databases.”
                    Multiple forms asking for same info (68.6%):
                    “The number of times you will have to specify your full name, IC & address”
                    Forms are too invasive (60%):
                    “In this day and age, giving out personal information is always unsettling. You’ll never know what it will be used for.”
                    “More details required than necessary, so more time spent for nothing.”
                    Ambiguous nature (extra):
                    Based responses to an open-ended question, it was found that the ambiguous nature of questions and a
                    lack of guidance given on attachments, were frustrating.
                    “The forms have questions which are rather open-ended/ambiguous and have no info button to explain what the question really requires.”
                    “There is no guidance on what certain documents should look like, i.e muka depan passport. Is this in reference to the front red cover of the passport, or the first page that has my face?”

                    Users aren’t seeing all the info they might need
                    of 50 HotJar examples reviewed, not many users actually used the tooltips
                    Did the user open at least one tooltip? Yes 16% No 84%
                    Partial Solution: Auto Tooltips
                    The customer will be able to see the full extent of the info we can give them, without needing to click away from the input.
                    Only one tooltip should show at a time. When focus is no longer on the input box it belongs to, the tooltip should disappear.
                    We can guarantee the customer will see the information in the tooltip, without overloading the screen with walls of text.
                    Only as effective as the text within. We should aim to provide examples of each finance type, or where to find these numbers.
                    We should try to keep the copy as short as possible.

                    Check to reveal
                    Fields that depend on the customer having a certain type of income or expenditure can be hidden behind checkboxes
                    This should stop customers from feeling like they have to fill out that field with a “0” and instead they can just ignore that checkbox
                    This should significantly reduce page length
                    Add Section
                    When kept entirely on one page, even with the dropdown format, our I&E sections were too big. This was too much information for our customers to process at once.
                    Hiding sections behind a button that makes them appear puts how much is seen at a given time in the customers hands.
                    This also reduces the initial page length to a more manageable size. The customer will only have one input to fill at the beginning.

                <h2>Visual Language</h2>
                <p>Opting for the “Interspersed” solution diversified the page layout, reducing the risk of visual
                    overload that the original Income and Expenditure (I&E) page carried. By breaking up the page across
                    several existing page, we reduced the monotony that was previously there when the user had to scroll
                    through every I&E question at once.
                    <br><br>
                    Replacing manual tooltip icon buttons with an automated process that makes additional information
                    appear when the user clicks on the actual input reduced visual clutter. This enabled us to ask more
                    elaborate questions where needed.
                    <br><br>
                    Implementing progressive disclosure allowed us to conceal non-applicable or optional questions,
                    streamlining the user interaction for increased efficiency.

                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p>Embracing the Interspersed solution ensured that users had ample time to review and consider their
                    answers, contributing to improved accuracy. Further research and feedback revealed the necessity for
                    a “Summary” page, aggregating all I&E inputs from the form, offering customers a final opportunity
                    to rectify errors before proceeding.
